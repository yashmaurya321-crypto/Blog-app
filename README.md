# Blog App

## Introduction
The Blog App is a platform where users can write, publish, and share their blogs with others. It features user authentication using JWT, registration and login pages, a home page displaying blogs, a comment section, and the ability to like and follow favorite writers. The app is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled with Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness.
